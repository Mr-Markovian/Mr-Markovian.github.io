      <description>Given a set of observations ${y1:y_n} \in \mathcal{X}$ which are samples from an unknown distribution $p(y)$, suppose that we would like to produce new samples similar to the above. What one then means is that they are tyring to learn the distribution $p(y)$ itself, through which they can sample new points. A model which will learn the distribuion from the samples and then generate samples from it is called a generative model.</description>

      <description>Three hundred and forty-eight years, six months, and nineteen days ago to-day, the Parisians awoke to the sound of all the bells in the triple circuit of the city, the university, and the town ringing a full peal.
The sixth of January, 1482, is not, however, a day of which history has preserved the memory. There was nothing notable in the event which thus set the bells and the bourgeois of Paris in a ferment from early morning.</description>
