      <description>Given a set of observations ${y1:y_n} \in \mathcal{X}$ which are samples from an unknown distribution $p(y)$, suppose that we would like to produce new samples similar to the above. What one then means is that they are tyring to learn the distribution $p(y)$ itself, through which they can sample new points. A model which will learn the distribuion from the samples and then generate samples from it is called a generative model.</description>
