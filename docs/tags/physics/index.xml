      <description>$$\mathcal{H}=\sum_{j,j}s_i s_j$$ Solving optimzation probelms, which deal in finding the best possible solution to a problem under certain constrained. Often at the heart of critical decision making processes in industrial and business problems which are both complex and high-dimensional in nature. Under some conditions, they sometimes become notoriously hard and often ones resorts to best achievable solutions instead of the best solution.
