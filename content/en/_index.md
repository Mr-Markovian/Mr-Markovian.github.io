Hello there. Welcome to my blog. I write about beautiful and interesting concepts and ideas in Statistics, Machine Learning and Quantum Computing and other things which I learn on a daily basis. This blog projects my current state of undertanding of things I am engaged in. I have tried to make concept explanations intuitive with real life simple examples, doodles and little bit of maths.
It also serves as a catalogue of my journey in the world's state space.
