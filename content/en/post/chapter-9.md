Singular Vector. Upscaleing of errors. AI and stochastically rounded low precision, enromous potential to imporve data assimilation schemes. AI to make better parametrizations. Signal to noise paradox paper(UK met office).
There are some cases where the atmosphere is more predictable than the ensemble. 
The nonlinearity can confine the ensemble into narrow regions of phase space, which reduces the uncertainity. Mention of forecast based finance aid. Limited area modeling is holding back so many developments. Certain neural networks are more skillful at predicting the unresolved scales. 

Something to learn is to implement decision models based on the above. 
A discussion on 4DVar is necessary. Singular vectors be used in 4DVar?
The covariance matrix 4DVar in reduced rank form, which is propagated to the next assimilation cycle.Non-modelaity of singular vector. The singular vectors at end of one analysis cycle, they are quite seperated in spectral space and this didn't work.

Will be possible to design methods with getting Operational forecasts are time constrained and this can impact the time of computation.
