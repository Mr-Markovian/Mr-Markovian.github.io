Solving optimzation probelms, which deal in finding the best possible solution to a problem under certain constrained. Often at the heart of critical decision making processes in industrial and business problems which are both complex and high-dimensional in nature. Under some conditions, they sometimes become notoriously hard and often ones resorts to best achievable solutions instead of the best solution. To take a refresher of the classical optimization problems as we know it, click here.

The purpose of this article is to explain different quantum algorithms applied to 
a class of optimization problems and their relative advantage. For a survey of classical algorithms, click here.
