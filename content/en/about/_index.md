description: "Greetings. I am PhD graduate student at International Center for Theoretical Sciences, TIFR Bangalore, India. I work on data assimilation and filtering algorithm related to numerical weather prediction. I look forward to applying machine learning and deep learninig algorithms to crack some of the problems in weather and climate modeling and prediction."

Stochastic control theory and data assimilation are concepts which both inspire and challenge me. I fell in love with their practical and philosophical value of in real life applications. Life is hardly far from uncertainities and at any time, we try to make best decisions based on the information(or Sigma algebra) and experience(Prior pdfs) and continuously improving them with the knowledge obtained through our experiences(observations). Future is yet to occur, but all our decisions(the models lies here) at the present moment consider how it can lead to the future we desire(Forecast). Besides, my interests are sparkled for learning new methodologies focusing on analysis and interpretation of complex and high-dimensional data.
